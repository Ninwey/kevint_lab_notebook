### HTML Lab 1

I completed the first exercises without any problem and did not use the videos for help. For the rest, I did use the videos because they were things I had not made before so it was a new thing to learn. The videos were very helpful in learning how to build each time of component and how to format them. Additionally, the exercises overall were very informative as well.

### Accessibility

Enter your reflections on this section here.

I was able to understand what the lab was asking for me to do and completed it without issue. However, the one thing I did run into where what I did was not right was the changing of the label from a collective component that encompassed all three radios to making individual ones when came to make the Favorite Character bullet points.

### CSS

I was able to complete most of the exercises without using the videos. The only time I used the videos was for the exercise 6- Media Queries as I was not familiar with using the @media rule to set the style for different screen sizes. I understood the concepts for these lab exercises fairly well, except for the @media rule, which took sometime to wrap my head around. I think having more exercises with using @media rule might be helpful for me.

### Flexbox

These two exercises were very difficult for me as I haven't had much pratice manipulating pieces of a website and moving them around. So for this section, I referenced the videos to help me understand what I specific CSS properties I should use to move the pieces around. Because I did not have that much experience with using flexbox I learned a lot of new things which I will carry with me and continually reference later in my career using CSS and HTML. I think this secton was explained really well and with the six exercises I was able to grasp the different ways to use flexbox pretty well.

### CSS-Grid

Similar to the flexbox exercises I hadn't worked a lot with manipulating grids areas with CSS. I had attempted to use what I learned from the flexbox exercises to complete 01-grid exercise however, I was struggling with understanding how to get my version of the exercise to look like the image given. So I refrenced the videos a lot for help in understanding what do. One thing I wanted to be better explained was the fr unit and how changing it affected the grid. I think providing a better explaination on that would be only change I would do. I don't think having more exercises would help me.

### Bootstrap

I was able to complete the first exercise without much issue as it was mainly using pre-made bootstrap items and copy and pasting them over. But I did use the videos to double check my work and make sure I did it correctly. For the remaining exercises I used the videos as a guide. The exercises overall were very helpful in helping me remember how to use bootstrap as I had prior experience using it during my high school web-design class.

### Javascript

I used videos as guide for me through these set of exercises as Javascript is something I have not used much. I found all of the exercises to be super helpful. I especially found the first three exercises and the fetch exercise to be very helpful as it helped me prepare for the third homework. However, I would've liked for more exercises similar to the first three where I can learn more about the base commands I can do in javascript.

### JQuery

I had a easier time with these exercises in terms of wrapping my head aorund what needed to be done because I did them right after I did the Javascript exercises. The videos were still used a lot as I was not familiar with the syntax I was asked to used. And I think the videos explained the concepts pretty well.
