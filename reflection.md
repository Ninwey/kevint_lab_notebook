### HTML Lab 1

I completed the first exercises without any problem and did not use the videos for help. For the rest, I did use the videos because they were things I had not made before so it was a new thing to learn. The videos were very helpful in learning how to build each time of component and how to format them. Additionally, the exercises overall were very informative as well.
